## How to train the model using CreateML

Open ModelTrainer.playground, start the project, set some parameters in order to enhance your model accuracy (# of Iteration, and Augumentation sub-sections), and then drag and drop your dataset sliptted into folder categories.

After your model training is complete, just drag and drop your test set to evaluate your model.

As we had to create our own data set, it was limited. In order to improve the accuracy, we used a 5-fold cross validation method to get our best model.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Once we had our model, we loaded in our iOS app (HigiaPrototype) to proof the concept and we built a MVP to demonstrate the potential use of this technology.
